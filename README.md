# Adventures-of-Sakai
This is a 2D Role Playing Game Retro Style game from the 80s and 90s made by me for a mini project in Java course in my university. So far the player can move around the map, there is collision detection.

# To-do
Many stuff waits to be implemented, including sounds, interaxctive objects, monsters and NPCs. I will hopefully be continuing this project when I have more time. 
I thank all my sources and the tutorials and the intro to game development articles that I read and watched on the internet. It seems now I love game making!
